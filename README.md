# Open Quantum Hardware Workshop

The 2021 Open Quantum Hardware Workshop is hosted by IEEE's Quantum Week, the IEEE International Conference on Quantum Computing and Engineering (QCE). [Registration](https://qce.quantum.ieee.org/registration/registration-overview/).

The virtual workshop will be held online on Tuesday, October 19th, 2021, 10:45 AM - 4:45 PM (Mountain Time). 

## Workshop Abstract

The past 5 years has witnessed an explosion of open-source tools for programming quantum computers. The open nature of these software tools has substantially increased the number of users of quantum computers, and created a whole new genre of programmer: the “quantum software engineer”. In turn, this has accelerated the development of quantum computing as a whole.
Much less attention has been paid to the tools and components actually used to build quantum computers and make them accessible. From electronic design and analysis, to control systems, to the “bare metal” itself, much work has gone on behind the scenes. These tools and components are relevant to the day-to-day work of electrical engineers, designers of quantum hardware, and researchers investigating co-design between hardware and software. However, these (and other) tools for “open quantum hardware” are not widely discussed, nor their applicability as well-appreciated in the open-source and academic quantum computing communities.
This workshop will bring together experts building these tools, and provide a clear overview of the state-of-the-art in open quantum hardware across design, control, and access to quantum computing systems. It will focus the conversation for the community of quantum engineers and software engineers on open challenges, including interoperability of these tools. In doing so, this workshop advances the development of quantum hardware — by accelerating the development of quantum technology solutions in open hardware — which, in turn, will produce an impact on the quantum technology ecosystem similar to that which has taken place in open quantum software.

## Talk Abstracts

#### Loic Henriet, PASQAL – “Pulser: An open-source package for the design of pulse sequences in programmable neutral-atom arrays”
**Abstract**
Programmable arrays of hundreds of Rydberg atoms have recently enabled the exploration of remarkable phenomena in many-body quantum physics. In addition, the development of high-fidelity quantum gates are making them promising architectures for the implementation of quantum circuits. We present here Pulser, an open-source Python library for programming neutral-atom devices at the pulse level. The low-level nature of Pulser makes it a versatile framework for quantum control both in the digital and analog settings. The library also contains simulation routines for studying and exploring the outcome of pulse sequences for small systems.
